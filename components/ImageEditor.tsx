        Analyze the uploaded floor plan image strictly with high precision regarding architectural symbols.
        
        1. **Architectural Symbols Analysis (CRITICAL)**:
           - **Windows vs Doors**: You must distinguish these carefully.
             - **Swing Door**: Look for a quarter-circle arc indicating the swing path.
             - **Window**: Look for a rectangle inside the wall thickness or a simple line closing a gap. If there is NO arc, it is likely a Window.
             - **Sliding Door**: Look for two overlapping lines or arrows, usually leading to a balcony or outside.
           
        2. **Layout & Spatial Mapping**:
           - Identify the main entrance.
           - Locate key furniture: Bed, Wardrobe, Desk/Work Zone, Sofa.
           - **Relative Positions**: Describe elements relative to each other (e.g., "Next to the work zone on the left is a large sliding door", "Opposite the bed is a TV console").
           
        3. **Materials & Style**: 
           - Focus on the overall style '${selectedIntStyle || 'Modern Luxury'}'.
           - Only use specific codes (like F1/C1) if they are clearly legible; otherwise, infer premium materials suitable for the style (e.g., Wooden floor, Gypsum ceiling).
           
        4. **Lighting**: 
           - Explicitly identify the main source of natural light (usually the sliding door or large window).
        
        [OUTPUT FORMAT]:
        Write a single, highly detailed English prompt for an AI Image Generator. 
        - Start directly with the scene description: "Eye-level view of a [Style] [Room Type]..."
        - Describe the position of every element precisely (Right wall, Left wall, Top/Bottom).
        - Ensure Windows and Doors are correctly described based on the visual symbols defined above.
        - End with: "8k resolution, photorealistic, cinematic lighting".
        - Do not include introductory text. Just output the raw prompt.
